# Not Space Invaders

Not Space Invaders is a clone of the 1978 arcade classic Space Invaders with more realistic 2D physics added into the mix. Nobody asked for them, but I added them anyway.

It is still in development. To run it on Linux, download the files and run
```
love ./
```
on the root folder (where ```main-lua``` is located). Make sure you have LÖVE 11.0 or higher installed.

You can also run it on Windows or wherever LÖVE runs, which can be done by learning how to do that.

### Controls

Controls are simple enough, simply use the keyboard arrow keys to control the ship and spacebar to fire.

### Screenshot

Below is a screenshot of the game in its current state (check the image commit to see which version it is).
